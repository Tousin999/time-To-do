# Time-To-do 

## Overview
A simple, interactive To-Do List application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with data persistence powered by `localStorage`.

## Features
* Add new tasks with a description and due date.
* Delete existing tasks.
* Toggle tasks as complete/incomplete.
* Tasks persist in the browser's `localStorage` even after closing/reopening the browser.
* Basic input validation (prevents empty tasks).
* Displays the task, due date, and creation date.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout (Flexbox).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and `localStorage` management.

## How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Tousin999/time-To-do.git](https://github.com/Tousin999/time-To-do.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd time-To-do
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Enhancements 
* Add an "Edit" feature for tasks.
* Implement drag-and-drop reordering of tasks.
* Filter tasks (e.g., show only active, completed, or all).
* Improved styling and responsiveness.
